So I decided to move from Wordpress to Jekyll.
Not that I had any complaints with Wordpress, it's an absolutely fantastic platform.
I just wanted to start [blogging like a hacker][tom].
Furthermore, I can host the site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

Feel free to copy code from the [github repository](https://github.com/tobanw/tobanw.github.io) that this site is generated from.
I've chosen a Creative Commons 4.0 license to encourage sharing.
