<p>When trying to explain the rationale behind the <a title="The Evolutionary Lifestyle: A Logical Theory of Health" href="http://tobanwiebe.com/2009/01/the-evolutionary-lifestyle-a-logical-theory-of-health/">evolutionary approach to health</a> (i.e., "paleo"), I often get accused of making the naturalistic fallacy ("natural is good"). This really irks me, as this objection reeks of an even worse fallacy: "natural is not good".</p>
<p>The reason the naturalistic fallacy is interesting and has its own name is because it's usually true, but not always, so we're liable to forget about the exceptions and commit the fallacy. In the realm of biology this correlation is especially tight, since species <em>adapt</em> to their environments through evolution. We need to be extra careful to not become blind to exceptions.</p>
<p>Consider my friend Ryan Murphy, who <a href="http://increasingmu.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/i-distance-myself-a-bit-from-taleb/">says that</a> "the paleo diet is just the naturalistic fallacy with a bit of evolutionary biology thrown in." Let me turn this statement on its head by agreeing with it and showing how it's a good argument for taking an evolutionary approach to nutrition. I'll start with the naturalistic fallacy and add supporting evidence from evolutionary biology. Each step should increase the probability that a paleo diet is an optimal human diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paleo diet is natural (probability $latex p$ of being true based on only this premise: $latex p \approx 0\%$)</li>
<li>Humans evolved as hunter gatherers on the African Savannah for hundreds of thousands of years until developing agriculture 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, implying that humans are adapted to this evolutionary environment ($latex p \geq 70\%$)</li>
<li>Humans have only <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.ca/2012/05/beyond-otzi-european-evolutionary_17.html">begun adapting</a> to agricultural foods; we are genetically still primarily hunter gatherers ($latex p \geq 75\%$)</li>
<li>Modern day <a href="http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-8b.shtml">hunter-gatherers exhibit excellent health</a>, free of the "diseases of civilization" ($latex p \geq 85\%$)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll stop there with a conservative estimate that a paleo diet is at least 85% likely to be an optimal human diet. Those are very good odds, and the downside risk is tiny, given the argument from evolutionary adaptation. Perhaps there is some other kind of diet that is superior (I consider this extremely unlikely for the same reason), but just as a matter of risk aversion, I would put my eggs in the paleo basket.</p>
<p>Let me also add that I think there are many errors to be weeded out of the paleo dogma— speculative positions that don't follow directly from evolutionary arguments: things like carbs are bad (hunter gatherers ate plenty of tubers!), fructose is bad (fruit is good), we need to eat tons of meat (we co-evolved with our prey, hunting wasn't easy), etc. There are many different types of paleo diets, as humans are adapted to a variety of ecological niches.</p>
<p>I'll wrap up by coming back to my initial point. The naturalistic fallacy objection to paleo is a straw man that misses the point. The argument for paleo depends on additional evidence from evolution, and derives additional support from anthropology. While Ryan is well versed in evolutionary theory and I think (hope) he doesn't make this mistake, I fear that others commit the error of thinking that, since natural doesn't imply good, then paleo isn't good. This is a far cruder fallacy! All the naturalistic fallacy implies is that paleo isn't <em>necessarily</em> good; but that doesn't mean there isn't a high <em>probability</em> that it <em>is</em> good.</p>
