<p>A constitutionally limited government provides the services of security and justice. To accomplish this, it establishes a system of national defense, police and courts—these are the means of production of security and justice. By definition then, limited government is socialist (i.e., state ownership of the means of production.) It's also socialist in the sense that the provision of security and justice is socialized: the costs and benefits are collectively shared. Furthermore, these services are funded through involuntary taxation and private citizens are coercively prohibited from competing in their provision. Government is inherently a coercive socialist monopoly. Therefore, constitutionalists are socialists, as they support limited government. (To be precise, constitutionalists are coercive socialists—I have nothing against voluntary socialism, which is perfectly legitimate.)</p>
<p>The thing is, they also consider the principles of liberty to be important. Constitutionalists believe that markets are better than central planning, but that government is necessary to protect liberty—that government is a necessary evil. This contradictory position mainly exists because they lack the understanding of the logical conclusion of the principles of liberty: the stateless society. But rather than just rejecting them as statists, we should reach out to them as potential libertarians in the spirit of <a id="i_.v" title="Gain vs Loss" href="http://boredzhwazi.blogspot.com/2007/05/gain-and-loss-2.html" target="_blank">gain orientation</a>. Fortunately, an open mind and a little education are all that's needed to arrive at a consistent pro-liberty position.<!--more--></p>
<p>On practical grounds, <a id="w9jt" title="Ludwig von Mises Institute" href="http://mises.org/" target="_blank">Austrian economics</a> is quite clear: the market always beats the State. Competition always beats monopoly. Why leave the government with any role at all if the market can provide us with everything we want? If the market is better than government in every other area, why would it fail in the so-called "essential roles of government": national defense, police and courts? The functions of both national defense and police could be produced more efficiently by entrepreneurs selling protection services. Private courts would easily provide better, speedier and more affordable justice than government courts. Security and justice are extremely important, all the more reason not to leave them in the hands of a coercive socialist monopoly. There is no place for the state in a free society; anything the government can do, the market can do better.</p>
<p>The state is also incompatible with basic moral principles. For instance, it is morally wrong to initiate violence against another person. Yet this is all the State can ever do, using "the strong arm of the law". Taxation is a perfect example, since a government couldn't exist without it. Taxes are not voluntary, they <em>must</em> be enforced with coercion. Government can only tax you because it has the overwhelming power to force you to pay. If it didn't have so much power, you could try to defend yourself. However, most people choose to pay because of this threat of violence (which, in any other scenario, would be recognized as extortion or robbery). If you don't pay, and insist on not paying, you will eventually be staring down the barrel of a government gun. After your non-compliance with their written requests, they will initiate violence against you by arresting you and putting you in jail (otherwise known as kidnapping). If you resist their efforts and attempt to defend yourself, you will be shot (murdered). Notice that the government is the aggressor—it initiates the violence. The person who refuses to pay does no more than defend himself from their attacks.</p>
<p>The State is a destructive parasite that is inherently immoral. Government <em>is</em> socialism—even the smallest one. <a id="tn24" title="Restoring the Libertarian Brand Name - LewRockwell.com" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig9/antman2.html" target="_blank">Les Antman nailed it</a> when he wrote that "limited government is the theory that free market capitalism is best protected by a socialist monopoly." There's no way around it: the State must go.</p>
<p>Most constitutionalists have a healthy anti-government attitude. They just don't realize that a society without government is both possible and desirable. They're ripe for becoming full-blown libertarians.</p>
<p>To learn about the workings of a stateless society, I recommend reading <a id="d5mh" title="Chaos Theory - by Robert P. Murphy" href="http://www.mises.org/store/Chaos-Theory-P190C0.aspx?afid=19" target="_blank">Chaos Theory</a> (only ~50 pages) [<a id="pd26" title="Chaos Theory" href="http://mises.org/books/chaostheory.pdf" target="_blank">pdf version</a>] or <a id="crdm" title="The Market For Liberty" href="http://www.mises.org/store/Market-for-Liberty-P302.aspx?afid=19" target="_blank">The Market For Liberty</a> [also in <a id="em-3" title="The Market For Liberty" href="http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a> and <a id="hfgu" title="The Market For Liberty" href="http://freekeene.com/free-audiobook/" target="_blank">audio-book</a>]. Another excellent short introduction is Roderick Long's <a id="tv07" title="Libertarian Anarchism: Responses to Ten Objections" href="http://mises.org/etexts/longanarchism.pdf" target="_blank">Libertarian Anarchism: Responses to Ten Objections</a>.</p>
