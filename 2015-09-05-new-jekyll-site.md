So I decided to move from Wordpress to [Jekyll][jekyll].
Not that I had any complaints with Wordpress, it's an absolutely fantastic platform.
I just wanted to start [blogging like a hacker][tom].
With Jekyll I can work from a text editor, use `git` for the entire site, and publish with a simple `git push`.
Furthermore, I can host the site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which automatically rebuilds the site whenever a change is made.

The comments were a cesspool back on Wordpress (and I'm talking about legitimate, non-spam comments here), so I'm nuking all the past comments and starting here with no commenting system for the time being.

I've chosen a Creative Commons 4.0 license to encourage sharing.
Feel free to copy code from the [github repository](https://github.com/tobanw/tobanw.github.io) that this site is generated from.
