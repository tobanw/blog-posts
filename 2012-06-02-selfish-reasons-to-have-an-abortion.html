<p>Abstract from moral considerations for a moment and consider a practical cost-benefit analysis of abortion. From an economist's point of view, abortion aversion is baffling. The costs of an unwanted pregnancy are often enormous, especially for young, unmarried women. Consider a girl in high school with decent grades and plans of attending college. If she gets pregnant, she has to choose between drastically different life paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario A: she gets an abortion, goes to college, gets a good career, finds a good husband, <em>and then</em> has children. With a comfortable financial situation and a father to help out, it becomes much less costly to have children (she will probably even have more kids than under Scenario B). No less important, the children will be much better off: better nutrition, better neighborhood, paternal investment, much better chance of affording college, etc.</li>
<li>Scenario B: she keeps the baby, which drastically reduces her chances of getting a college degree. As a result, her career prospects are significantly lower. She also takes a big hit to her mate value—men place a large discount on single mothers, for good evolutionary reasons (e.g., evolution punishes investing in genetically unrelated children). So she has given up a good career and marriage for single motherhood. She is greatly worse off, and so is the child.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I'm an outlier, but if I were placed in this position, I would be willing to pay at least $250,000 to avoid Scenario B. This would surely be less than the difference in discounted lifetime earnings added to the difference in the value of husbands across the two scenarios.</p>
<p>As such, I'm utterly baffled that unmarried, intelligent atheist women will even consider Scenario B. Either they aren't thinking through the costs and benefits or their moral cost of abortion is ridiculously high (or infinite, as is the case with sacred values).</p>
<p>The bottom line: we're leaving $250,000 bills on the ground because of moral qualms about abortion. A cultural shift in the direction of greater acceptance of such practical abortions would have huge economic benefits for those in such a position.</p>
<p>P.S. This is why I loved Sarah Silverman's "quickie aborsh" stunt!</p>
