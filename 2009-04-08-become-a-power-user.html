<p>Most people fall far short of tapping the full potential of their computing because they don't take advantage of the best free software programs. Using the right tools is the most effective thing a person can do to become a more effective computer user. To help people accomplish this, I've assembled a list of the best free software programs (many are open source), and I will be updating it regularly to keep it current. By using the best tools, not only does computer work become more efficient, it often becomes enjoyable. For example, most people find email infinitely more pleasant when using Gmail, and likewise with Firefox and web browsing. While you probably won't need them all, you should at least try out the ones labeled <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[Must have!]</span></strong></span></span>. So give them a try; I think you'll be impressed!</p>
<p>I'll update the list as needed to keep it current. That way, it won't get old and out of date. Leave your comments and suggestions on this post (comments disabled on the article).</p>
