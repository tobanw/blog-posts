<p>I plan to become an economics professor and spend my life in the intellectual world. This is a huge life decision, so I asked myself: What drives my intellectual passion? I have to admit that, in large part, it's the pleasure I get from the utter intellectual demolition of stupid but comforting beliefs. The more feel-good and popular the belief, the more satisfaction I glean from putting it through the intellectual shredder.</p>
<p>It's not that I love to argue with people (I enjoy it a bit, but I get sick of it very quickly). I get the most satisfaction just from reading a book that destroys an inane but popular belief. While it does make me feel good inside, I think it also appeals to the optimist in me: think of how much better the world would be if these beliefs were replaced with more intelligent ones.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that my favorite subjects to study are economics and evolution, which I dual-wield as intellectual war-hammers for bashing simpleton feel-good beliefs.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/the_ideological_2.html">Bastiat is the icon</a>, attacking economic fallacies <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basSoph.html">with wit and zeal</a>. There are so many examples of <a href="http://libertariananarchy.com/2008/12/ecognorance/">wrongheaded economic thinking</a>, but it will suffice to mention a few here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum wage amounts to the following nonsense: "Some workers' wages are too low. Therefore we should ban low wages." Economics (or just common sense) says that employers will fire these workers rather than take a loss on them.</li>
<li>Any talk about jobs creation is deeply misguided. Work is a cost, to be minimized. Furthermore, all the hand-wringing about unemployment and insufficient demand overlooks a simple fact: markets clear. At lower wages, more workers are hired.</li>
<li>The arguments for overpopulation and resource depletion completely neglect the effects of increased population on productivity. More people means a finer and more efficient division of labor, and more technological innovation. Resource depletion is an overblown concern, since market prices rise when there are shortages. This reduces demand, increases supply, and creates profit opportunities for innovators to increase supply or find substitutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p>No, I'm not talking about creationist bashing. <a href="http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.ca/2008/08/who-is-against-evolution.html">There's a lot of politically correct wishful thinking</a> about sex differences and evolutionary psychology smacks it right on the mouth. It's especially satisfying to demolish inane feminist arguments about "patriarchy", "oppression", and other horseshit which does not pass the muster of evolutionary analysis. Men compete so fiercely for mates that there's no way they've formed a 'cartel' to keep women down.</p>
<p>An evolutionary approach to health also smashes some sacred cows (e.g., "saturated fat is bad, despite over a million years of evolution as meat eaters", or "you should protect yourself from sunlight, even though sunlight is so biologically important that Europeans evolved pale skin just to absorb more of it").</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="http://mises.org/daily/4700">evolutionary psychology can explain</a> where a lot of dumb ideas come from.</p>

<p>I have long wondered if there is a certain personality type that predisposes one the be open to libertarian ideas. I now think that there is: the love of smashing feel-good beliefs. Those who don't share this passion are much less likely to be thrilled about libertarian ideas. They hold on to their comforting beliefs and try to find sophisticated ways to defend them (or they downplay the issue to avoid undermining them.) Libertarians, on the other hand, have no sympathy for feel-goodery.</p>
