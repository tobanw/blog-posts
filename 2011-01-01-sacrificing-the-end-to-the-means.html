<p>In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/117328592X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=highthou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=117328592X" target="_blank">Economic Sophisms</a></em>, Bastiat tears the protectionist arguments to pieces and makes a powerful case for <em><a href="http://libertariananarchy.com/articles/the-case-for-free-trade/" target="_blank">freedom of trade</a></em>. In particular, he exposes the widespread jobs fallacy that pervades so much of the popular press and political discourse.</p>
<p>The jobs fallacy is the belief that job creation promotes prosperity. It just seems obvious that more jobs means more prosperity: more jobs means more income. Politicians are constantly clamoring about job creation. But there's a subtle error here. Bastiat points out the absurdity of this argument.</p>
<p>Labor is a means to the end of consuming goods. The means is not the end, and all value derives from the end. Labor itself does not make us prosper—the results of labor are what we consider prosperity. Labor itself impoverishes us—it is costly: at the very least we lose leisure time. We only engage in labor because we expect the products of labor to enrich us more than the labor impoverishes us. What we're after is to make a profit—a surplus of enrichment over impoverishment. We want to maximize the ratio of product to labor, of output to input, of result to effort.<!--more--></p>
<p>Obviously, the best possible case would be to have all result with no effort—no work and an abundance of goods. The worst possible case would be all work and no result (which Bastiat called 'Economic Sisyphism'). Protectionists, who argue that free trade eliminates domestic jobs, are actually advocating a reduction in the result to effort ratio. They want to reduce the amount of cheap goods—the "result"—coming from abroad, and increase the amount of effort—"create more jobs"—required to produce a given result. Wouldn't it be wonderful if foreigners put us all out of work by flooding us with free goods? Wouldn't it be awful if all trade between persons were prohibited and each one of us had to be self-sufficient, fully employed for every waking hour, yet barely (or not even) surviving?</p>
<p>The jobs fallacy is a part of a larger fallacy: favoring the interests of producers over consumers, i.e., favoring the means over the end. Production is only a means to the end of consuming the goods produced. Production derives its value from the value of the product. If some goods are no longer valued, their production loses its value. Production itself is not a source of value.</p>
<p>Consumer demand is the source of value. The more people are willing to pay for a good, the more producers of that good will be willing to pay for the inputs required to manufacture it, and so on until value is imputed all the way back to labor, land, and natural resources. In this way, the entire economic structure of production is dictated by consumers, via the price structure established by this backwards imputation of value.</p>
<p>Since all value is derived from consumer demand, it follows that satisfying consumer wants to the greatest extent possible maximizes prosperity. Promoting production can only increase prosperity to the extent that it satisfies consumer wants. But interfering with free trade always harms the interests of consumers and thus impoverishes. Therefore, free trade is the optimal policy.</p>
<p>It's common for people to think that if domestic producers earn more due to a trade restriction, then they will spend those extra earnings, and the money will work its way through the economy, and no harm will have been done. This is a perfect illustration of the fallacy of the seen and the unseen, as Bastiat put it. The gain to the protected industry is highly visible—the number of jobs "created" is easily countable. But the losses to consumers are harder to see—each consumer loses a tiny bit because of the higher price of the protected good, but summing across all consumers, the loss is greater than the "gain". Similarly, removing the protections will cause a highly visible loss of jobs, but also a small enrichment to each consumer, which adds up to a net gain. To downplay these small increases in consumers' prosperity is to stand in the way of human progress. The history of progress has consisted of innumerably many such small enrichments of consumers.</p>
<p>Crusoe economics can add valuable insight into this problem. Consider a small group that washes up on an isolated island after a shipwreck. If there were a friendly primitive population on a neighboring island willing to trade with them, to do so would be in their interest. We can immediately see that "protecting the domestic producers" by restricting trade is a pure loss. Clearly, labor has an opportunity cost: increasing the amount of labor required to produce a given output impoverishes the islanders. That extra labor could have instead been spent resting, or on other productive activities, such as fashioning tools.</p>
<p>It's all too easy to fall for Keynesian sophisms when thinking about a modern economy in all its bewildering complexity. Hence the importance of reasoning from fundamental principles and using conceptual tools such as Crusoe economics to avoid lapsing into fallacy.</p>
<p>In summary, the jobs fallacy is at root a confusion about the source of prosperity. Jobs are only a means to prosperity. Job creation via protectionist measures is literally <em>sacrificing the end to the means</em>.</p>
