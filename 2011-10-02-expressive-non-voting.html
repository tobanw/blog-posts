<p>In Bryan Caplan's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691138737/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=libertarch-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0691138737">The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="assets/ir?t=libertarch-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0691138737&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, he explains how voters are "rationally irrational". Since the probability of any single vote influencing the outcome of an election is vanishingly small, there is no incentive for voters to spend time informing themselves in order to vote wisely. So rather than vote for the best policies, voters indulge (rationally) in <a href="http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e410/pc11.htm" target="_blank">expressive voting</a> ("irrational"), e.g., showing support for an ideal/party, or being part of the democratic process for its own sake.</p>
<p>Libertarians often don't vote because there are no candidates that represent their principles. Furthermore, many libertarians dislike voting and would prefer not to participate in a coercive political process even if it is democratic. So libertarians are often <strong>expressive non-voters</strong>. Since our individual votes won't make any difference, we may as well not vote—to express our objections to the coercive nature of democracy (as well as its non-trivial practical failings.) This way, when people bring up the topic in conversation, we can explain why we don't vote (and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/04/jason_brennans.html" target="_blank">why they shouldn't either</a>.) If other voters are going to vote expressively and ruin policy, then libertarians might be most effective by expressively non-voting.</p>
