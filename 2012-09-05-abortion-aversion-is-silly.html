<p>In a previous post, I <a title="Selfish Reasons to Have an Abortion" href="http://tobanwiebe.com/2012/06/selfish-reasons-to-have-an-abortion/">expressed my bafflement</a> at the existence of abortion aversion among intelligent atheist women. My argument was that an unmarried woman who gets pregnant while still in school/college takes on an enormous opportunity cost by keeping the baby (I estimated at least a quarter million dollars).</p>
<p>Economists take preferences as given, but it seems to me that there is significant scope for criticizing preferences. For example, Indians have an aversion to eating beef because cows are sacred in their culture. Now, billions of people eat beef and it's perfectly fine; their lives are better for it. If Indians could drop their beef aversion, they would also be better off for it. In fact, we ought to encourage them to do so. There's no place for religious superstition in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no room for superstitious aversion to abortion. Our modern understanding of biology tells us that nothing morally significant happens at conception. To a biologist, it's religious to think otherwise. Sure, you could say, it's a continuum and we have to pick a cutoff of moral significance. To this, I respond with common sense: a ball of cells is obviously not morally significant (how could we have evolved moral instincts for it?); a birthed baby is. The cutoff is somewhere in the middle. So there's no reason to have qualms about early abortions.</p>
<p>We rightly criticize moral values based on superstition, like beef and pork aversion. We should also criticize other moral values that impose large costs. Many costly evolved instincts can be overridden by reason, e.g., the <a href="http://mises.org/daily/4700">astoundingly costly anti-market biases</a>.</p>
