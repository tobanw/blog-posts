<p>One mindlessly repeated claim is that a weak dollar boosts exports. While <a title="Sacrificing the End to the Means" href="http://tobanwiebe.com/2011/01/sacrificing-the-end-to-the-means/">I think that promoting exports is lunacy</a>, I'm going to investigate this claim and show that devaluations can only cause temporary, one-shot increases in exports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose the dollar loses value in the currency exchange markets, but domestic goods prices have not changed.</li>
<li>Now, foreigners in the currency exchange markets will buy up dollars 'on sale' and use them to buy US goods (which haven't yet increased in price.)</li>
<li>This arbitrage process is the temporary boost in exports: export goods get a disproportionate share of the increased foreign demand, so export prices rise before input prices.</li>
<li>But it is only temporary: extra demand also bids up US goods prices to the point that there is no longer any gain to arbitrage.</li>
<li>This general price rise is inflation, and it precisely counterbalances the devaluation.</li>
<li>Exporters lose their advantage as the inflation hits the prices of inputs.</li>
<li>Thus, once the markets equilibrate, exporters have made a transient gain at the expense of everyone who was holding dollars (which fell in value both on the currency exchange markets and in domestic purchasing power.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to see that exporters derive no long run advantage is to notice that, relative to their foreign competition, they have not gained any comparative advantage. Their costs have not fallen, hence they cannot cut prices. So they can only sell the at the same price and quantity as before, and earn the same rate of profit.</p>
<p>I hope this makes it obvious how stupid it would be to enact a policy of devaluation for export stimulus. The harms of inflation borne by the entire populace would greatly overshadow any transient benefit to exporters.</p>
