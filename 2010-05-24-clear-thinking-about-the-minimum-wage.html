<p>Everybody knows that the minimum wage is a good policy, right? Problem is, they're all wrong. Economists proved long ago that price controls can't work—they only create shortages and surpluses. The minimum wage is a price floor: if it is set above the market wage it will create a surplus, leaving some workers unable to sell their labor. The overall popularity of a minimum wage is perhaps the best example of <a href="http://libertariananarchy.com/2008/12/ecognorance/" target="_blank">ecognorance</a>, and it can only be corrected through <a href="http://fee.org" target="_blank">economic education</a>. Some simple reasoning will go a long way towards clearing up the minimum wage confusion.</p>
<p>Consider the following thought experiment: suppose that the minimum wage is raised to $1000/hour. What are the implications? Evidently, most employers can't pay that much and they'll go out of business. If that weren't so, we could all become fantastically wealthy just by decreeing a ridiculously high minimum wage. Now suppose that the minimum wage is lowered to $0.01/hour. Again, employers won't pay that wage (even though they'd like to) because other firms are bidding for the same workers, and this drives wages up. The reason employers don't pay the decreed wages is that wages are determined by supply and demand, not government edict. Firms hire workers with the goal of earning profits, while wages are costs. They competitively bid wages up to the point where the wage (cost) equals the benefit or extra profit gained from hiring that worker. So competition for profits practically ensures that workers get paid according to their productivity, according to the value of their labor. (In economics jargon, they get paid their discounted marginal revenue product.)</p>
<p>Now let's trace out the effects of an increase in the minimum wage on the employers affected (e.g., those hiring unskilled labor). First, the increased labor costs lead some firms to lay off workers and others to shut down, since demand for their goods and hence their prices have not changed. But the downsizing and shutdowns reduce the supply of the goods, increasing their price. This new, higher price justifies the higher wage for those who kept their jobs, since they are now producing a more valuable product. The end result is that some workers lose their jobs, while the rest enjoy the higher wage. Consumers lose because prices are now higher.</p>
<p>Since workers are paid according to their productivity (like all factors of production), all the minimum wage does is to make it illegal to buy or sell labor beneath the price floor. The government is essentially saying: "You must be <em>this</em> productive to legally work in our country." This is most harmful to the least skilled of workers, the ones we want to help most. They will be the first to be fired, and will be cut off from the chance to gain the work experience and job skills needed to earn a legal wage. Allowing such people to work for lower than minimum wages gives them a chance to work their way to a better life. To deny them the freedom to negotiate their own wages and to leave them legally prohibited from working is a moral outrage.</p>
<p>Some clever economists might argue that the minimum wage can increase the total wages paid to all workers. This could happen if the amount of workers unemployed was more than offset by the increased wage. But what is this except human sacrifice?! They would knowingly unemploy the most needy in order to increase the aggregate income of workers. This position is morally bankrupt and an insult to those who genuinely want to help the less fortunate.</p>
<p>In sum, the minimum wage harms the very people it intends to help. It's a moral outrage that ought to be instantly abolished. Freedom is the best policy to help the poor.</p>

<li>Gene Callahan's excellent analogy, in which he compares the minimum wage with a hypothetical "minimum stock price". Find it in his book, <a href="http://mises.org/books/econforrealpeople.pdf" target="_blank">Economics for Real People</a> (free online), pages 189-194.</li>
