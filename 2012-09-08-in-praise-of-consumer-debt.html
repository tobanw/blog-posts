<p>Debt is a wonderful thing. But many intelligent and responsible people have debt aversion, believing that the optimal level of debt is zero. They proudly brag when they've paid off their mortgages that they are debt-free. This is flat out stupid.</p>
<p>One of the great things about debt is that it allows us to trade future wealth for present wealth at the price of interest. For most people, income rises substantially over their lifetime. Because of diminishing marginal utility (a dollar is worth more to you when you're poor than when you're rich), it would be utility-maximizing to transfer some of that future wealth to your present self (given a sufficiently low interest rate). This is even more true of students: they live very poorly as they invest in their earnings potential, then they get jobs and experience a dramatic reversal of their income (from negative to large positive). Debt allows us to smooth out wealth over our lifetime, yielding a gain in utility at the cost of interest.</p>
<p>Most people are perfectly comfortable taking on huge levels of debt to buy a house. This is good. But a lot of people are way too squeamish about borrowing to increase their present standard of living. Yes, people are risk averse and don't want to be stuck with a debt they can't pay. This reduces the optimal level of debt, but not necessarily to zero.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that people who expect a large increase in future income (with a high degree of certainty) should be more willing to use debt to finance consumption spending: buying the stuff that makes life better, the stuff you'd buy once you have that higher income.</p>
<p>Debt is economically equivalent to savings (assuming the same rate of interest applies to both). How is that possible, you say? In both cases the opportunity cost is the same: if you buy something with borrowed money, you have to pay the interest cost of the loan; if you paid with saved money, the hidden opportunity cost is the interest foregone. So the opportunity cost is equal.</p>
<p>Thus, my argument applies generally to savings and debt. Why should your poor present self save for your rich future self? It should really be your rich future self that pays the debts of your poor present self!</p>
<h2>Appendix</h2>
<p>Here is a useful method for deciding whether to make a large purchase with long run benefits (whether using debt or savings).</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimate the duration of the benefits and assign a monetary value to the benefit flow (e.g., $<em>x</em>/year for <em>n</em> years). (This assumes constant benefits over time for simplicity.)</li>
<li>Calculate the payments (in the same units as the benefit flow) required to pay off a debt in the amount of the purchase over the lifetime of the benefits. This is easy to do using the PMT function in a spreadsheet. Then simply compare the benefit flow to the expected financing cost; since both are in the same units, it's easy to see if the purchase is worth it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: My brother recently got laser eye surgery. It cost $2000, and we conservatively assumed an interest rate of 5%, and that the benefits would last 40 years. The spreadsheet formula is then =PMT(0.05,40,2000) and outputs an annual payment of $116. Since he valued the benefits at no less than $200/year, it was clear that this was a good purchase.</p>
