<p>Unlike other lifestyles, diets and exercise plans; the <strong>evolutionary lifestyle</strong> is based on theory, not on empirical evidence. We know it's a healthy lifestyle without even looking at any studies. This is crucially important for two major reasons. First, the conclusions of research studies seem to be constantly changing. There is still wide controversy in the field of health (unlike in chemistry or physics), which brings me to the second reason: government tainted science. Governments (tax-funded monopolies) have horrible incentives, so their involvement in the field of health is sure to spread misinformation and lies. In most countries, the government publishes recommendations for diet, exercise and other health-related topics. Given the perverse incentives of governments, it's extremely important to question such nutritional guidelines. Fortunately, we can sidestep the empirical research by using evolutionary theory, which actually turns out to be a much more reliable and accurate way to discover the healthiest lifestyle.</p>
<p>The theory can be stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Given that humans are the product of evolution, the lifestyle that </em><em>the human body has adapted to through evolutionary natural selection will tend to be optimally healthy</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we accept the assumption that humans evolved through Darwinian adaptation, then we can conclude that our bodies have become specialized in a certain lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) and this lifestyle will be optimal for good health. If we want to be healthy, all we need to do is read up on our evolutionary history. No research studies required.</p>
<p><a id="fbi1" title="Evolution - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" target="_blank">Evolution</a> is the process by which random mutations of the genes (DNA) that happen to confer an advantage to the organism survive and outcompete the old genes (and vice versa for bad genetic mutations). This positive feedback system, over thousands of generations, improves the genetic blueprint of the species. But evolution is not perfect; it is a process of continual improvement. The length of time (or the number of generations) that a species exists under certain conditions determines how much adaptation will occur. That is why the theory states that the evolutionary lifestyle will <em>tend</em> to be optimally healthy.</p>
<p>Unless critics can somehow disprove the theory, then all the research studies in the world wouldn't be able to invalidate the thesis. Ultimately, however, if the theory is correct, the empirical research must illustrate it, by definition. I believe that it already does, but I won't get into the empirical side here.</p>
<p>The evolutionary lifestyle is highest standard in the field of health, because the theory is logically, not empirically, derived. (Technically, it's logically derived from the theory of evolution, which is empirically derivedâ€”but that's a pretty solid empirical theory!) No longer are we to remain at the mercy of the ever changing nutritional advice of the empiricists. We now have a theory that will enable us to cut through the controversy and get straight to the facts.</p>
