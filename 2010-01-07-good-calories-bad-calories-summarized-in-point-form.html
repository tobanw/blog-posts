<p>Gary Taubes's masterpiece—<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=highthou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1400033462">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="assets/ir?t=highthou-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400033462" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />—is the most important book ever written on diet and health. Drawing from an astounding body of research, Taubes challenges the conventional wisdom head on and decisively wins (the book is perhaps overkill.) He shows that carbohydrates are the root cause of obesity and most chronic diseases, and that fat is not only innocent, but positively beneficial. The book was so amazingly good that after finishing it, I decided to read it through again and take extensive notes for future reference. Now that I've finished, I figure that these notes could be quite useful as a reference to others who've read the book, or even as an overview to get more people to read the book. These notes are no substitute for reading the book though. They were written as a reference to complement the book and I strongly recommend reading it through in its entirety. Armed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=highthou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1400033462">Taubes's book</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="assets/ir?t=highthou-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400033462" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> and these notes, you'll be a low-carb, high-fat force to be reckoned with!</p>
