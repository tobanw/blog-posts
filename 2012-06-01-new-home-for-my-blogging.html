<p>I've been blogging so infrequently that I've decided to consolidate my blogging here. I've moved my posts and comments over from my blogs <em>Higher Thought</em> and <em>Libertarian Anarchy</em>, so it'll feel just like home.</p>
<p>As always, my posting philosophy is quality over quantity. So subscribe to the feed here:Â <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TobanWiebe">http://feeds.feedburner.com/TobanWiebe</a>.</p>
