<p>The idea that we should "buy local" or that goods should be produced locally is fairly popular, but economically incoherent. There seems to be two main arguments for localism: 1) that long distance transportation is wasteful, and 2) that local spending benefits the local economy and makes people better off. Both arguments are wrong: localism is wasteful and can only impoverish us.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, all goods are produced locally to some people (at least the producers and their neighbors). Why does the location of production matter at all? A head of lettuce moving in a refrigerated truck is the same as a head of lettuce sitting in the refrigerator of the local store. Transportation doesn't change the nature of the product. Furthermore, "local" is an arbitrary point on a continuum—is local 100 or 1000 miles? Why not 101 or 1001 miles? Taken to its logical conclusion, localism implies that everyone should be a self-sufficient producer and eschew all trade—it doesn't get any more local than that. To put it bluntly, localism is a bad idea, based on a non-understanding of the economics of trade. Trades are mutually beneficial (else they would not occur) on all levels: from local to global.</p>
<p>Consider an Alaskan and a Colombian trading salmon and coffee. Despite the great distance separating them, this arrangement is the cheapest way of providing the Alaskan with coffee and the Colombian with salmon. If they were to "buy local" they would have to resort to very costly (wasteful) methods of production (such as greenhouses or cold-water tanks) or forgo the product entirely. Needless to say, they are both much worse off without trade.  The general principle I've outlined is that cost, not location, is the key factor. Alaskans can produce salmon at a much lower cost than Colombians, who can produce coffee at a much lower cost than Alaskans. If the savings from using efficient production exceed the transportation costs, then they both gain by trading because they can acquire the other product at a lower cost than if it were produced locally. By specializing and trading, they minimize waste and conserve scarce resources. To forgo mutually beneficial trades because of location is to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>The economics lesson here is about scarcity. Since resources are scarce, we must economize their use in order to maximize prosperity. By using the lowest cost methods of production, we minimize the amount of resources that are used up in producing goods. This leaves more resources for the production of other goods, increasing our well-being. In other words, the least cost method is the least wasteful method. So rather than worry about where the product comes from, just look at its price. If local goods happen to be cheaper, then they were produced less wastefully. Same for faraway goods. (Keep in mind, however, that this only holds in a free market, as government distorts prices which hides true costs). A lower price means that less resources were used in bringing the product to you (including the resources used up in transportation). This is why so many goods are produced non-locally: the savings from producing in a more efficient location exceed the costs of transportation. We all benefit from these savings by enjoying more goods at lower prices.</p>
<p>Globalization is often smeared as evil, but in truth, it is one of the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/alex_tabarrok_foresees_economic_growth.html" target="_blank">greatest triumphs</a> of human civilization. Localism is the real evil as it engenders waste, which can only bring poverty. <a href="http://libertariananarchy.com/articles/the-case-for-free-trade/">Global free trade</a> is the engine of worldwide prosperity and continues to be one of the most important solutions in the eradication of world poverty.</p>
